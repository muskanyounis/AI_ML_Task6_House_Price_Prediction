# Task 6: House Price Prediction

## Objective:
To build a regression model that predicts house prices based on various features using machine learning.

## Dataset Used:
- House Sales in King County, USA (from Kaggle)
- Renamed as `house.csv` before using in the notebook

## Process:
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and checked correlations
- Cleaned data by removing irrelevant columns like 'id' and 'date'
- Applied One-Hot Encoding to categorical variables
- Scaled features using StandardScaler
- Built a Linear Regression model
- Evaluated model using MAE, MSE, and RMSE

## Key Results:
- Linear Regression model achieved reasonable accuracy for predicting house prices
- RMSE and MAE values show model performance
- Some features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and condition highly influenced price

## Skills Applied:
- Data preprocessing (scaling, encoding)
- Regression model building
- Error metrics interpretation (MAE, MSE, RMSE)
- Data visualization and EDA
